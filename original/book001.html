<H1 CLASS="chapter"><A NAME="htoc1">Chapter&#XA0;0</A>&#XA0;&#XA0;Preface</H1><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc1"></A>The strange history of this book</H2><P>In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming
class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting
frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for
students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</P><P>One of the problems I saw was the books. 
They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and
not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all
suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy,
proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would
fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast,
and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</P><P>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my
own book. 
My goals were:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages
than not read 50 pages.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon
and define each term at first use.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult
topics and split them into a series of small steps. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included
the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</LI></UL><P>I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <EM>How to Think Like
a Computer Scientist</EM>.</P><P>My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading,
and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard
topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the
students practice.</P><P>I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License,
which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</P><P><A NAME="@default0"></A>
<A NAME="@default1"></A></P><P>What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school
teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into
Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the
unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.</P><P>Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by
Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released <EM>How to Think Like
a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</EM>, also under
the GNU Free Documentation License.
As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling
hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores.
Other books from Green Tea Press are available at
<TT>greenteapress.com</TT>.</P><P>In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach
Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking.
Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting
projects, and generally had a lot more fun.</P><P>Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book,
correcting errors, improving some of the examples and
adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work
on a major revision&#X2014;at the same time, I was
contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who
was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!</P><P>The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title
<EM>Think Python</EM>. Some of the changes are:</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter.
These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding
bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">I removed the material in the last few chapters about the
implementation of lists and trees. I still love those topics, but I
thought they were incongruent with the rest of the book.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of
understanding to a few substantial projects.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">I added a series of case studies&#X2014;longer examples with
exercises, solutions, and discussion. Some of them are based on
Swampy, a suite of Python programs wrote for use in my classes.
Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from
<TT>thinkpython.com</TT>.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">I expanded the discussion of programming development plans
and basic design patterns.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The use of Python is more idiomatic. The book is still about
programming, not Python, but now I think the book gets more leverage
from the language.</LI></UL><P>I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps
you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like
a computer scientist.</P><P>Allen B. Downey<BR>

translated my Java book into Python, which got this project
started and introduced me to what has turned out to be my
favorite language.</P><P>I also thank Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections
to <EM>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</EM>.</P><P>And I thank the Free Software Foundation for developing
the GNU Free Documentation License, which helped make
my collaboration with Jeff and Chris possible.</P><P><A NAME="@default2"></A>
<A NAME="@default3"></A></P><P>I also thank the editors at Lulu who worked on
<EM>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</EM>.</P><P>I thank all the students who worked with earlier
versions of this book and all the contributors (listed
below) who sent in corrections and suggestions.</P><P>And I thank my wife, Lisa, for her work on this book, and Green
Tea Press, and everything else, too.</P><H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="toc3"></A>Contributor List</H2><P><A NAME="@default4"></A></P><P>More than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers have sent in
suggestions and corrections over the past few years. Their
contributions, and enthusiasm for this project, have been a
huge help.</P><P>If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to 
<TT>feedback@thinkpython.com</TT>. If I make a change based on your
feedback, I will add you to the contributor list
(unless you ask to be omitted).</P><P>If you include at least part of the sentence the
error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search. Page and
section numbers are fine, too, but not quite as easy to work with.
