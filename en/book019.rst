Chapter 18  Inheritance
--------------------------------------


In this chapter we will develop classes to represent playing cards,
decks of cards, and poker hands. If you don
’t play poker, you can
read about it at 
wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker, but you don’t have
to; I’ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.







If you are not familiar with Anglo-American playing cards,
you can read about them at wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards.

18.1  Card objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


There are fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of
four suits and one of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts,
Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge). The ranks are
Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on
the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King
or lower than 2.







If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is
obvious what the attributes should be: 
rank and
suit. It is not as obvious what type the attributes
should be. One possibility is to use strings containing words like
'Spade' for suits and 'Queen' for ranks. One problem with
this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to
see which had a higher rank or suit.







An alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and suits.
In this context, 
“encode” means that we are going to define a mapping
between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This
kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that
would be “encryption”).



For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer
codes:

Spades↦3Hearts↦2Diamonds↦1Clubs↦0

This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to
higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes.



The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks
maps to the corresponding integer, and for face cards:

Jack↦11Queen↦12King↦13

I am using the ↦ symbol to make is clear that these mappings
are not part of the Python program. They are part of the program
design, but they don’t appear explicitly in the code.







The class definition for Card looks like this:



.. sourcecode:: python

    class Card:
        """represents a standard playing card."""
    
        def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=2):
            self.suit = suit
            self.rank = rank



As usual, the init method takes an optional
parameter for each attribute. The default card is
the 2 of Clubs.







To create a Card, you call Card with the
suit and rank of the card you want.



.. sourcecode:: python

    queen_of_diamonds = Card(1, 12)

18.2  Class attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~






In order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily
read, we need a mapping from the integer codes to the corresponding
ranks and suits. A natural way to
do that is with lists of strings. We assign these lists to 
class
attributes:



.. sourcecode:: python

    # inside class Card:
    
        suit_names = ['Clubs', 'Diamonds', 'Hearts', 'Spades']
        rank_names = [None, 'Ace', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', 
                  '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King']
    
        def __str__(self):
            return '%s of %s' % (Card.rank_names[self.rank],
                                 Card.suit_names[self.suit])



Variables like suit_names and rank_names, which are
defined inside a class but outside of any method, are called
class attributes because they are associated with the class object Card.







This term distinguished them from variables like suit and rank, which are called instance attributes because they are
associated with a particular instance.







Both kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For
example, in 
__str__, self is a Card object,
and 
self.rank is its rank. Similarly, Card
is a class object, and 
Card.rank_names is a
list of strings associated with the class.



Every card has its own suit and rank, but there
is only one copy of suit_names and rank_names.



Putting it all together, the expression
Card.rank_names[self.rank] means “use the attribute rank
from the object 
self as an index into the list rank_names
from the class Card, and select the appropriate string.”



The first element of rank_names is None because there
is no card with rank zero. By including 
None as a place-keeper,
we get a mapping with the nice property that the index 2 maps to the
string 
’2’, and so on. To avoid this tweak, we could have
used a dictionary instead of a list.



With the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards:



.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> card1 = Card(2, 11)
    >>> print card1
    Jack of Hearts



Here is a diagram that shows the Card class object
and one Card instance:











Card is a class object, so it has type type. card1 has type Card. (To save space, I didn’t draw the
contents of suit_names and rank_names).

18.3  Comparing cards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~










For built-in types, there are conditional operators
(
<, >, ==, etc.)
that compare
values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or equal to
another. For user-defined types, we can override the behavior of
the built-in operators by providing a method named__cmp__. 



__cmp__ takes two parameters, self and other,
and returns a positive number if the first object is greater, a
negative number if the second object is greater, and 0 if they are
equal to each other.







The correct ordering for cards is not obvious.
For example, which
is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher
rank, but the other has a higher suit. In order to compare
cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.



The answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep
things simple, we
’ll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more
important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds,
and so on.







With that decided, we can write __cmp__:



.. sourcecode:: python

    # inside class Card:
    
        def __cmp__(self, other):
            # check the suits
            if self.suit 
    > other.suit: return 1
            if self.suit 
    < other.suit: return -1
    
            # suits are the same... check ranks
            if self.rank 
    > other.rank: return 1
            if self.rank 
    < other.rank: return -1
    
            # ranks are the same... it's a tie
            return 0    



You can write this more concisely using tuple comparison:







.. sourcecode:: python

    # inside class Card:
    
        def __cmp__(self, other):
            t1 = self.suit, self.rank
            t2 = other.suit, other.rank
            return cmp(t1, t2)



The built-in function cmp has the same interface as
the method 
__cmp__: it takes two values and returns
a positive number if the first is larger, a negative number
of the second is larger, and 0 if they are equal.







Exercise 1  
Write a 
__cmp__ method for Time objects. Hint: you
can use tuple comparison, but you also might consider using
integer subtraction.

18.4  Decks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~






Now that we have Cards, the next step is to define Decks. Since a
deck is made up of cards, it is natural for each Deck to contain a
list of cards as an attribute.







The following is a class definition for Deck. The
init method creates the attribute 
cards and generates
the standard set of fifty-two cards:











.. sourcecode:: python

    class Deck:
    
        def __init__(self):
            self.cards = []
            for suit in range(4):
                for rank in range(1, 14):
                    card = Card(suit, rank)
                    self.cards.append(card)



The easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop. The outer
loop enumerates the suits from 0 to 3. The inner loop enumerates the
ranks from 1 to 13. Each iteration
creates a new Card with the current suit and rank,
and appends it to self.cards.





18.5  Printing the deck
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~










Here is a __str__ method for Deck:



.. sourcecode:: python

    #inside class Deck:
    
        def __str__(self):
            res = []
            for card in self.cards:
                res.append(str(card))
            return '\n'.join(res)



This method demonstrates an efficient way to accumulate a large
string: building a list of strings and then using 
join.
The built-in function 
str invokes the __str__
method on each card and returns the string representation.







Since we invoke join on a newline character, the cards
are separated by newlines. Here’s what the result looks like:



.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> deck = Deck()
    >>> print deck
    Ace of Clubs
    2 of Clubs
    3 of Clubs
    ...
    10 of Spades
    Jack of Spades
    Queen of Spades
    King of Spades



Even though the result appears on 52 lines, it is
one long string that contains newlines.

18.6  Add, remove, shuffle and sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


To deal cards, we would like a method that
removes a card from the deck and returns it.
The list method pop provides a convenient way to do that:







.. sourcecode:: python

    #inside class Deck:
    
        def pop_card(self):
            return self.cards.pop()



Since pop removes the last card in the list, we are
dealing from the bottom of the deck. In real life bottom dealing is
frowned upon
1,
but in this context it’s ok.







To add a card, we can use the list method append:



.. sourcecode:: python

    #inside class Deck:
    
        def add_card(self, card):
            self.cards.append(card)



A method like this that uses another function without doing
much real work is sometimes called a 
veneer. The metaphor
comes from woodworking, where it is common to glue a thin
layer of good quality wood to the surface of a cheaper piece of
wood.







In this case we are defining a “thin” method that expresses
a list operation in terms that are appropriate for decks.



As another example, we can write a Deck method named shuffle
using the function shuffle from the random module:







.. sourcecode:: python

    # inside class Deck:
                
        def shuffle(self):
            random.shuffle(self.cards)



Don’t forget to import random.



Exercise 2  

Write a Deck method named sort that uses the list method
sort to sort the cards in a Deck. sort uses
the 
__cmp__ method we defined to determine sort order.



18.7  Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~






The language feature most often associated with object-oriented
programming is 
inheritance. Inheritance is the ability to
define a new class that is a modified version of an existing
class.







It is called “inheritance” because the new class inherits the
methods of the existing class. Extending this metaphor, the existing
class is called the 
parent and the new class is
called the child.



As an example, let’s say we want a class to represent a “hand,”
that is, the set of cards held by one player. A hand is similar to a
deck: both are made up of a set of cards, and both require operations
like adding and removing cards.



A hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for
hands that don
’t make sense for a deck. For example, in poker we
might compare two hands to see which one wins. In bridge, we might
compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid.



This relationship between classes—similar, but different—lends
itself to inheritance. 



The definition of a child class is like other class definitions,
but the name of the parent class appears in parentheses:







.. sourcecode:: python

    class Hand(Deck):
        """represents a hand of playing cards"""



This definition indicates that Hand inherits from Deck;
that means we can use methods like 
pop_card and add_card
for Hands as well as Decks.



Hand also inherits __init__ from Deck, but
it doesn
’t really do what we want: instead of populating the hand
with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should initializecards with an empty list.







If we provide an init method in the Hand class, it overrides the
one in the Deck class:



.. sourcecode:: python

    # inside class Hand:
    
        def __init__(self, label=''):
            self.cards = []
            self.label = label



So when you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method:



.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hand = Hand('new hand')
    >>> print hand.cards
    []
    >>> print hand.label
    new hand



But the other methods are inherited from Deck, so we can usepop_card and add_card to deal a card:



.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> deck = Deck()
    >>> card = deck.pop_card()
    >>> hand.add_card(card)
    >>> print hand
    King of Spades



A natural next step is to encapsulate this code in a method
called move_cards:







.. sourcecode:: python

    #inside class Deck:
    
        def move_cards(self, hand, num):
            for i in range(num):
                hand.add_card(self.pop_card())



move_cards takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of
cards to deal. It modifies both 
self and hand, and
returns None.



In some games, cards are moved from one hand to another,
or from a hand back to the deck. You can use 
move_cards
for any of these operations: 
self can be either a Deck
or a Hand, and hand, despite the name, can also be a Deck.



Exercise 3  
Write a Deck method called 
deal_hands that takes two
parameters, the number of hands and the number of cards per
hand, and that creates new Hand objects, deals the appropriate
number of cards per hand, and returns a list of Hand objects.



Inheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be
repetitive without inheritance can be written more elegantly
with it. Inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can
customize the behavior of parent classes without having to modify
them. In some cases, the inheritance structure reflects the natural
structure of the problem, which makes the program easier to
understand.



On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read.
When a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its
definition. The relevant code may be scattered among several modules.
Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be
done as well or better without it. 

18.8  Class diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


So far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of
a program, and object diagrams, which show the attributes
of an object and their values. These diagrams represent a snapshot
in the execution of a program, so they change as the program
runs.



They are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too
detailed. A class diagrams is a more abstract representation
of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual
objects, it shows classes and the relationships between them.



There are several kinds of relationship between classes:



- Objects in one class might contain references to objects
  in another class. For example, each Rectangle contains a reference
  to a Point, and each Deck contains references to many Cards.
  This kind of relationship is called 
  HAS-A, as in, “a Rectangle
  has a Point.”
- One class might inherit from another. This relationship
  is called IS-A, as in, “a Hand is a kind of a Deck.”
- One class might depend on another in the sense that changes
  in one class would require changes in the other.








A class diagram is a graphical representation of these
relationships
2. For example, this diagram shows the
relationships between Card, Deck and Hand.







The arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A
relationship; in this case it indicates that Hand inherits
from Deck.



The standard arrow head represents a HAS-A
relationship; in this case a Deck has references to Card
objects.







The star (*) near the arrow head is a 
multiplicity; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has.
A multiplicity can be a simple number, like 
52, a range,
like 
5..7 or a star, which indicates that a Deck can
have any number of Cards.



A more detailed diagram might showed that a Deck actually
contains a list, which contains Card, but built-in types
like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.



Exercise 4  
Read 
TurtleWorld.py, World.py and Gui.py
and draw a class diagram that shows the relationships among
the classes defined there.

18.9  Debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~






Inheritance can make debugging a challenge because when you
invoke a method on an object, you might not know which method
will be invoked.







Suppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects.
You would like it to work with all kinds of Hands, like
PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method like
shuffle, you might get the one defined in Deck,
but if any of the subclasses override this method, you
’ll
get that version instead. 







Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your
program, the simplest solution is to add print statements at the
beginning of the relevant methods. If 
Deck.shuffle prints a
message that says something like 
Running Deck.shuffle, then as
the program runs it traces the flow of execution.



As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an
object and a method name (as a string) and returns the class that
provides the definition of the method:



.. sourcecode:: python

    def find_defining_class(obj, meth_name):
        for ty in type(obj).mro():
            if meth_name in ty.__dict__:
                return ty



Here’s an example:



.. sourcecode:: python

    >>> hand = Hand()
    >>> print find_defining_class(hand, 'shuffle')<class 'Card.Deck'>



So the shuffle method for this Hand is the one in Deck.







find_defining_class uses the mro method to get the list
of class objects (types) that will be searched for methods. 
“MRO”
stands for “method resolution order.”







Here’s a program design suggestion: whenever you override a method,
the interface of the new method should be the same as the old. It
should take the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the
same preconditions and postconditions. If you obey this rule, you
will find that any function designed to work with an instance of a
superclass, like a Deck, will also work with instances of subclasses
like a Hand or PokerHand.



If you violate this rule, your code will collapse like (sorry)
a house of cards.

18.11  Exercises
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Exercise 5  

The following are the possible hands in poker, in increasing order
of value (and decreasing order of probability):



:pair: two cards with the same rank
:two pair: two pairs of cards with the same rank
:three of a kind: three cards with the same rank
:straight: five cards with ranks in sequence (aces can
  be high or low, so 
  Ace-2-3-4-5 is a straight and so is 10-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, but Queen-King-Ace-2-3 is not.)
:flush: five cards with the same suit
:full house: three cards with one rank, two cards with another
:four of a kind: four cards with the same rank
:straight flush: five cards in sequence (as defined above) and
  with the same suit





The goal of these exercises is to estimate
the probability of drawing these various hands.



# Download the following files from thinkpython.com/code:

:Card.py: A complete version of the Card,Deck and Hand classes in this chapter.
:PokerHand.py: An incomplete implementation of a class
  that represents a poker hand, and some code that tests it.



# If you run PokerHand.py, it deals six 7-card poker hands
  and checks to see if any of them contains a flush. Read this
  code carefully before you go on.
# Add methods to PokerHand.py named has_pair,
  has_twopair, etc. that return True or False according to
  whether or not the hand meets the relevant criteria. Your code should
  work correctly for 
  “hands” that contain any number of cards
  (although 5 and 7 are the most common sizes).
# Write a method named classify that figures out
  the highest-value classification for a hand and sets the
  label attribute accordingly. For example, a 7-card hand
  might contain a flush and a pair; it should be labeled “flush”.
# When you are convinced that your classification methods are
  working, the next step is to estimate the probabilities of the various
  hands. Write a function in 
  PokerHand.py that shuffles a deck of
  cards, divides it into hands, classifies the hands, and counts the
  number of times various classifications appear.
# Print a table of the classifications and their probabilities.
  Run your program with larger and larger numbers of hands until the
  output values converge to a reasonable degree of accuracy. Compare
  your results to the values at wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_rankings.






Exercise 6  





This exercise uses TurtleWorld from Chapter 4.
You will write code that makes Turtles play tag. If you
are not familiar with the rules of tag, seewikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game).



# Download thinkpython/code/Wobbler.py and run it. You
  should see a TurtleWorld with three Turtles. If you press theRun button, the Turtles wander at random.
# Read the code and make sure you understand how it works.
  The 
  Wobbler class inherits from Turtle, which means
  that the 
  Turtle methods lt, rt, fd
  and 
  bk work on Wobblers.The step method gets invoked by TurtleWorld. It invokes 
  steer, which turns the Turtle in the desired direction,
  wobble, which makes a random turn in proportion to the Turtle’s
  clumsiness, and 
  move, which moves forward a few pixels,
  depending on the Turtle’s speed.
# Create a file named Tagger.py. Import everything from
  Wobbler, then define a class named Tagger that inherits
  from Wobbler. Call make_world passing the Tagger class object as an argument.
# Add a steer method to Tagger to override the one in
  Wobbler. As a starting place, write a version that always
  points the Turtle toward the origin. Hint: use the math function
  atan2 and the Turtle attributes x, y andheading.
# Modify steer so that the Turtles stay in bounds.
  For debugging, you might want to use the 
  Step button,
  which invokes step once on each Turtle.
# Modify steer so that each Turtle points toward its nearest
  neighbor. Hint: Turtles have an attribute, 
  world, that is a
  reference to the TurtleWorld they live in, and the TurtleWorld has
  an attribute, 
  animals, that is a list of all Turtles in the
  world.
# Modify steer so the Turtles play tag. You can add methods
  to 
  Tagger and you can override steer and
  __init__, but you may not modify or override step, wobble or move. Also, steer is allowed to change the
  heading of the Turtle but not the position.
  Adjust the rules and your steer method for good quality play;
  for example, it should be possible for the slow Turtle to tag the
  faster Turtles eventually.




You can get my solution from thinkpython/code/Wobbler.py.
